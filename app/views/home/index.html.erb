  <strong>I'm up to...</strong>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="btn btn-danger btn-sm">CURRENT</span> Trying to render the 'search' form on the the search results page. This is working, however perhaps if I render the form and use the way the 'edit' page works, it will remember the preferences.</li>
    <li>Trying to make a form with check boxes that updates the user's clients (on the Profiles/show/ page).</li>
    <il>Changed 'clients' to 'projects'; need to create join tables for A) Users/Projects B) Clients/Projects</il>
    <li>Need to work out a way that uploading a CSV file to projects adds the project to a client (using the client field in the CSV file)</li>
    <hr>
    <li>Creating Help pages, need to print out all help files, display categoriess on the side and manage who can see what + make use of anchor_ids</li>
    <li>Work out how to change colour/styling of the alerts + use FontAwesome rather than images for icons.</li>
    <li>Creating the user_controller and making an admin and a super admin <span class="btn btn-warning btn-sm">In Progress, privelages for admin/super need to be defined</span></li>
    <li>Need to limit profile create to 1 per user and prevent them from seeing anyone else's profiles</li>
    <li>Need to restrict access to view/edit user profiles to ONLY the user it belongs to (unless an admin)</li>
    <li>Added CanCan parameters to restrict who can edit profils/view profiles (admin can edit/see all, users can only see/edit their own)<span class="btn btn-success btn-sm">Done!</span></li>
    <li>Created an admin panel restricted to admins and suepr admins only + help page for how to use the site as admin or user + contact page<span class="btn btn-success btn-sm">Done!</span></li>
    <li>Create a 'delete' def in user to log out a user <span class="btn btn-success btn-sm">Done!</span></li>
    <li>Redirecting a user to the 'create a profile' page automatically after log in if they haven't set up a profile using "if current_user.profile" <span class="btn btn-success btn-sml">Done!</span></li>

  <ul>Things to ask Matt
    <li>Have I done the correct thing regarding assigning users to a client by having a URL?</li>
    <li>Have I filtered the database correctly for projects?</li>
  </ul> -->
  <hr>
  <% User.all.each do |user| %>
    <%= user.email %> | <%# link_to 'Delete', destroy_me_path, method: :delete, data: { confirm: "You sure?" } %>
    <%= link_to 'Delete User', user_path(user), method: :delete, data: { confirm: 'Are you sure?' } %>
  <% end %>
  <% else %>

  <strong>Dean, please see below before using the site:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Remember that you'll need to <%= link_to 'assign yourself', manage_users_path %> to clients otherwise you won't see anything in the Sold Position page</li>
    <li>You can use the <%= link_to 'admin panel', admin_path %> to upload a CSV file</li>
    <li>The new column is labled 'location' so the first row in the table you upload will just need to be the same.</li>
    <li>I haven't had time just yet to create the 'select all projects' button, so for now, when filtering, click a project then hit "Ctrl+A" and that should select all. Then just hit search.</li>
  </ul>
